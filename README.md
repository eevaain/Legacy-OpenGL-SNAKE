## 2-D Snake in OpenGL C++ 
simple snake game i made in openGL GLUT. 
Followed this tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Miai_t_ksw&list=PLWzp0Bbyy_3gXc0YBxiIR9Tb5KfmLSL_C

- Added my own collision detection with snake bumping into itself as well as a few other small things
- Learned significance of Double Frame Buffers, callback functions, taking arguments by reference

intentions:

- i wanted to get better at low-level programming -> uncover the black box behind computer graphics

- i wanted to make snake in 6502 assembly on my homebrew computer but i had no clue how to approach making it.
