## 2-D Snake in OpenGL c++ 
simple snake game i made in openGL GLUT. 
Followed this tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Miai_t_ksw&list=PLWzp0Bbyy_3gXc0YBxiIR9Tb5KfmLSL_C

- Added my own collision detection with snake bumping into itself as well as a few other small things
- Learned significance of Double Frame Buffers, callback functions, taking arguments by reference
