## 2-D Snake in Legacy OpenGL C++

Simple snake game i made in openGL GLUT. 
Followed this tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Miai_t_ksw&list=PLWzp0Bbyy_3gXc0YBxiIR9Tb5KfmLSL_C

- Added my own collision detection with snake bumping into itself as well as a few other small things.
- Made own graphics using propietary glut vertex functions (turning coordinates into shapes)
- Learned significance of Double Frame Buffers, callback functions, taking arguments by reference.

intentions:
- i'm an amateur programmer and i can barely consider myself a full-stack developer. wanted to start developing a deeper competency in problem-solving
  with code rather than sit on my ass and write monkey lizard brain markup frontend code (sorry frontend devs)

- i wanted to get better at low-level programming -> uncover the black box behind computer graphics. 
- i wanted to make snake in 6502 assembly on my homebrew computer but i had no clue how to approach making it. now i somewhat have a clue :)
